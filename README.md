# battleship


notes to self for tomorrow
-so i started out feeling really good as i set this project up. 

-I'm still happy with what i've done so far, my biggest sticking point so far
is working with the board squares as an object. it's generally confusing.

-i'm having trouble accessing and incrementing the proper squares on the board that i want to be in. 

-i had a decent place ship function going, but ran into troubles in terms of logic that prevented the ship from wrapping when reaching the end of the board. 

-one thing that crossed my mind is creating another class for board squares, then i could have booleans for if it contains a ship, if it's got a missed hit, if it's got a hit hit.

-honestly, if i set up the board squares like that, then instead of making the whole board an object, i made it out of those classed squares i think i'd be cooking.

--------plan upon your return-------
-see if you can make a square class with booleans
-remove the logic that creates the board as a giant object, it's confusing and i think it's too much for what i'm trying to do.
-that will mean i have to refactor a bunch of other shit but i think it's worth.
